                NAM is Non-Automated Mined and it's a mobile app that allows users to upload receipts to earn
                a collectible token called NAM Coins. By leveraging blockchain technology, our platform turns
                receipts into a gamified rewarding experience. Unlike existing crypto where the mining pools are
                owned by who controls the most capital, NAM Coins are only mined when your consciousness
                is present to make a purchase.
              </p>
              <p>
                NAM is the first of its kind where the tokens are created and distributed based on the user's share of transactions relative to others each day. NAM Coins will
                always be free and users will never have to purchase them to participate. Simply upload
                receipts through the NAM Rewards app and get rewarded to a crypto wallet to start collecting
                them for free. This whitepaper outlines the vision, tokenomics, the business, and philosophy
                behind NAM Rewards.

                  Half the population in the U.S. don't own any assets and they're already priced out of homes
                  and stocks. It's also hard to get into crypto because they have to learn about it, be convinced of
                  it, and risk their hard earned money just to get started. At the same time, reward apps today
                  award points that are nearly worthless, expire, and usually at best, are only worth a few
                  percentages of value relative to the purchase.

                  you already make, and earn coins straight into a crypto wallet depending on how much you've

                  NAM Coins are memecoins inspired by Dogecoin. We're going to use it to model NAM Coin's
                  tokenomics but with our own takes and improvements. There will be 14.4 million new coins
                  mined each day - the same inflationary rate as Dogecoin. This amounts to 5.256 billion new
                  coins per year in inflation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dogecoin gave early miners a significant advantage by allowing them to mine 100 billion coins,
                  nearly 20 years worth of inflation, in just one and a half years. This created whales and a
                  significant disadvantage for anyone that came after that. As of this month, September 2025,
                  more Dogecoins were mined in that time than every year combined thereafter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With NAM Coins, inflation will start and remain constant. There will be no ICO, no pre-allocation,
                  nor air-drops. The only advantage early adopters get is that their receipt uploads will make up a
                  larger percentage of the transaction volume when the network is small compared to when the
                  network is big.

                  On the launch of the MVP app, the creation and distribution of NAM Coins will start. Users will
                  be able to download the app, start uploading pictures of receipts, and start earning NAM Coins.
                  Each day 50% of the tokens will be issued to the platform and 50% of the tokens will be issued
                  to the users based on their transaction volume. The total issued will be 14.4 million per day, 7.2
                  million tokens going to both the platform and users. From the user pool, every user will be
                  awarded tokens based on their share of the transaction volume.

                  NAM Rewards will partner with businesses to confirm transactions and allow them to start
                  collecting NAM Coins. This will grow the network, reduce fraud, and decentralize the protocol.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Phase 2, 50% of the tokens, which is 7.2 million, will be reserved for transactions at
                  businesses that have partnered with NAM Rewards. In this pool, 50% of the tokens will be
                  issued to the customer based on their transaction volume, 25% to the businesses, and 25% to
                  the platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The rest of the tokens, 7.2 million tokens, will be issued in the same way as Phase 1. Half the
                  tokens from this pool which is 3.6 million will go to the platform and 3.6 million will go to the
                  users. Every transaction is eligible to earn from this pool. However, only verified transactions at
                  partnered businesses will qualify for the new pool.

                <p>
                  Over time, with scale, the inflation will stay the same but the protocol will be updated to give a
                  heavier weight for transactions at partnered businesses and give a smaller weight to
                  transactions that occur everywhere else. This is a way to give more weight to the virtuous cycles
                  that grow the network and prevent fraudulent reward claims that ruin the game for everyone
                  else. By working with businesses to confirm the transactions, we can make sure the game
                  remains fair for everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The plan is to increase the weight of tokens issued for transactions through partnered
                  businesses to 90% or more and reduce the weight of unconfirmed transactions down to 10% or
                  less. This model will ensure that every transaction that's working to reinforce and grow the
                  network gets rewarded more while the transactions that can't be directly confirmed still get
                  rewarded but less. It will also give more tokens to the businesses and less to the platform which
                  will increasingly decentralize the ownership over the protocol in the long run.

              <p>
                NAM Coins are created with similar tokenomics as Dogecoin but the way it's created and
                distributed is different. With Dogecoin, the ownership of the mining pool that earns the new
                coins is determined by the amount of wealth a person has to invest in the hardware and upkeep
                to own these automated systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                NAM Coins are the first to be created and distributed based on how much a person spends in
                their local community relative to other people each day. This is the vision behind NAM which
                stands for Non-Automated Mined. NAM Coins aren't mined by automated processors in data
                centers, instead they're only mined when you're physically present for a transaction.

              <p>
                As mentioned in the tokenomics, over time, businesses will be able to work with NAM to confirm
                receipt transactions and also start mining NAM Coins after each verification. The businesses will
                simply pay a monthly subscription fee for software services in order to give their customers
                more rewards for each transaction as well as mine the coins for themselves. In the beginning,
                the businesses will earn from a pool of 12.5% tokens created each day and eventually move up
                to about 25% as outlined in the tokenomics.

              <p>
                The economy is splitting in two. It works for the wealthy but not for most people. Government
                policies, like printing money, boost asset prices such as stocks and real estate. This helps the
                rich but makes life expensive for everyone else. Housing, healthcare, and basics are harder to
                afford. People are spending less, and money isn't moving through the economy like it should
                relative to the amount that's out there. The biggest indicator that this is happening is the Velocity
                of M1 Money Stock - the amount of times money moves around relative to the liquid money
                supply.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our rewards app and token aim to fix this. We want to bring everyone into decentralized finance
                and make them into asset owners so that no one is left behind. By earning tokens through
                uploading receipts, users can join DeFi, trade, and grow their wealth. We also want to make
                spending fun again. You earn tokens only by spending and uploading receipts, which
                encourages people to spend more in their local community. This boosts the economy,
                empowers users, and creates a fairer system where everyone can build wealth.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is the philosophy of NAM. Funnel everyone into DeFi, turn them into asset owners, and
                create an incentive for people to spend more in their local economy. The protocol will be iterated
                over time to make the distribution more fair in terms of reducing cheaters and exploiters. What
                won't change is the inflation which is 14.4 million tokens per day - the same as Dogecoin. The
                idea is that by creating a memecoin that's more methodical in distribution and a more fair game
                overall, there's no reason NAM Coins can't beat out Dogecoin as the top memecoin over time.
